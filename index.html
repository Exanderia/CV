      <p><em>Wife and Mother of the <strong>Bynum Bunch</strong></em></p>
      <p>I met my husband in February of 2011 in <a href="https://www.durango.org/">Durango Colordo</a> and married him on August 11, 2012. We had our son in September of 2013. In June of 2014 we moved to <a href="https://www.cityofboise.org/">Boise Idaho</a> with a caravan of Nick's family. Shortly after settling we discovered we were pregnant wth our daughter, whom was welcomed into the world April 2015. We bought our first house in <a href="https://middleton.id.gov/">Middleton Idaho</a> in December 2016. We then added a pup to our family that February. July of 2018 we had our second baby girl. Since then we have been enjoying watching our family grow into beautiful little humans. </p></td>
